# Machine Learning Classification project deployment on Streamlit

I've created this machine learning classification generalize model
on streamlit where you can use any dataset after preprocessing.

You can analyze your dataset & check the accuracy for different classification models along with different parameters in this streamlit app.

I've used a titanic dataset available on Kaggle.

If you've any questions, you can check the streamlit documentation page.
